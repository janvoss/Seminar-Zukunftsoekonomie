	abstract = {The website Sci-Hub provides access to scholarly literature via full text {PDF} downloads. The site enables users to access articles that would otherwise be paywalled. Since its creation in 2011, Sci-Hub has grown rapidly in popularity. However, until now, the extent of Sci-Hub's coverage was unclear. As of March 2017, we find that Sci-Hub's database contains 68.9\% of all 81.6 million scholarly articles, which rises to 85.2\% for those published in closed access journals. Furthermore, Sci-Hub contains 77.0\% of the 5.2 million articles published by inactive journals. Coverage varies by discipline, with 92.8\% coverage of articles in chemistry journals compared to 76.3\% for computer science. Coverage also varies by publisher, with the coverage of the largest publisher, Elsevier, at 97.3\%. Our interactive browser at greenelab.github.io/scihub allows users to explore these findings in more detail. Finally, we estimate that over a six month period in 2015�2016, Sci-Hub provided access for 99.3\% of valid incoming requests. Hence, the scope of this resource suggests the subscription publishing model is becoming unsustainable. For the first time, the overwhelming majority of scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone.},

	title = {Who's downloading pirated papers? Everyone},
	abstract = {In increasing numbers, researchers around the world are turning to Sci-Hub, the controversial website that hosts 50 million pirated papers and counting. Now, with server log data from Alexandra Elbakyan, the neuroscientist who created Sci-Hub in 2011 as a 22-year-old graduate student in Kazakhstan, Science addresses some basic questions: Who are Sci-Hub's users, where are they, and what are they reading? The Sci-Hub data provide the first detailed view of what is becoming the world's de facto open-access research library. Among the revelations that may surprise both fans and foes alike: Sci-Hub users are not limited to the developing world. Some critics of Sci-Hub have complained that many users can access the same papers through their libraries but turn to Sci-Hub instead�for convenience rather than necessity. The data provide some support for that claim. Over the 6 months leading up to March, Sci-Hub served up 28 million documents, with Iran, China, India, Russia, and the United States the leading requestors.},
